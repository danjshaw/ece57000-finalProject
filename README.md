Subject: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models

Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685

All of my implementation is contained in the one file, `LoRA_NLU.pynb`, and was run on Google Colab using the A100 GPU runtime type with high ram. See `requirements.txt` for my environment setup. My demo video is packaged in the `demo.zip` file - note resolution was reduced in order to get the file to fit on GitHub.
